# extract transform load (etl) process by using Python
     Download the zip file and extract it.       
     I have put some .txt and .csv files in sample_data folder to test the program for etl process.
     Run the etltest.py file with python to test the sample files transform with etl process.
     After running the program ,you will get 4 transformed files of respective sample files.
       
    THIS PROGRAM EXTRACT .txt AND .csv FILES. IT TRANSFORM THEM BY CAPITALISING THE COLUMN IN .txt FILE
    AND DOING WORD COUNT IN .csv FILE.
    FINALLY IT LOADS THE TRANSFORMATION MADE TO  NEW .txt AND .csv FILES RESPECTIVELY.
